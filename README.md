1. Prepare data by merging across all five years.
    Keep only the CONTROL and FMR variables.
    After merging you should have the CONTROL variable and FMR values for all five years.
    Delete entire Housing Unit if FMR is ‘missing’ or ‘negative’.
2. Provide descriptive statistics on FMR. Numerical as well as graphical.
3. Do appropriate analysis to compare the pairwise differences in Fair
   Market Rents (FMR) across the five years, 2005 through 2013.
4. Prepare a brief summary report.
    The set of variables used in the regression model and a brief justification for their use.
    The estimated regression model along with explanation of any variable transformations you have done.
    Interpretation of the impact of various variables included in your model.
